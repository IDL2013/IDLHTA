I am a health economist at the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), where I've worked since 2019. Prior to this I worked in the pharmaceutical industry for nearly a decade, in a variety of roles relevant to the development and communication of evidence for Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of medicines. 

Alongside my day job, I'm interested in how data science and machine learning could be used to simplify many of the resource-intensive processes involved in HTA, both from the perspective of manufacturers compiling evidence dossiers and the decision-making bodies critiquing them. 

I've been spending some time learning about data science, R programming and web development, and plan to use this site to develop some of my ideas.

If you're interested enough in these areas to have read this far down, feel free to connect!
